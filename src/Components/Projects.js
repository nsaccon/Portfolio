                This project is a C# console application that interacts with
                Docusignâ€™s API as part of a <b>billing system integration</b>. Created for a local law firm, this application
                automatically charges clients for signed paperwork after the
                signature process is completed. The need for this project arose
                as part of the Covid-19 strategy to allow lawyers to work more
                efficiently from home.
